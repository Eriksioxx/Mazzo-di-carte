# memory-game

Through JS, I reconstructed the popular MEMORY game, a popular card game for children that requires concentration and memory, in which players must pair cards.

There are two game modes: one with countdown and a limited number of movements, and one where you can play quietly in relaxation.

Countdown allows you to increase the difficulty of the game as you level up.

A movement limit has also been imposed to make the game more interesting.

The graphics are basic, but are based on operation that encapsulates the basic elements of this popular game.

Have fun! :D :D
